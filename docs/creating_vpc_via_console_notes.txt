### STEP 1: CREATE A VPC ###

1) Navigate to VPC in aws console and select "Create vpc from scratch"

2) Put 10.0.0.0/16 as IPv4 CIDR. And Default tenancy as tenancy
More info on VPC IP address ranges - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.html

In general it is reccomended you put the following as IP address ranges:
10.0.0.0/16
172.31.0.0/16
192.168.0.0/20

The above are IPv4 IP address ranges. For simplicity select the option that says "NO IPv6 IP address ranges"


### STEP 2: CREATE A PUBLIC SUBNET ###
1) build a public subnet (make sure that you are assigning valid cidr blocks when creating your subnet)
IPv4 Cidr block: 10.0.0.0/25

2) after subnet is created, go into subnet settings and click on the box that says "enable auto-assign public IPv4 address"

For subnet cidr ranges - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-sizing.html


### STEP 3: CREATE A PRIVATE SUBNET ###
1) build a private subnet (make sure you're assigning valid cidr blocks)
    ipv4 cidr: 10.0.0.128/25


### STEP 4: CREATE ROUTES & CONFIGURE INTERNET GATEWAY ###
1) create internet gateway and after its created, click on actionsd and click on "attach to vpc"
2) create a new route table (for hte public subnet) to direct traffic to public subnet
    a) Click on route table and click on actions adn then click on "associate a subnet" and click on the public subnet
    b) Click on "add routes" under routes (while the route table is being selected), for the route put "0.0.0.0/0",
    for the target put your internet gateway

    c) for private route table, do a subnet association for the private subnet
Note:
You may notice there is already a default route table created for you associated with your main network.
This route allows traffic from the 10.0.0.0/16 network to pass to other nodes within the network,
but it does not allow traffic to go outside of the network, such as to the public internet.
Each VPC you create by default is associated with this main route table;
therefore, the main route table shouldn't allow traffic out to the public internet,
so we'll create a new one specifically for public internet traffic.



### STEP 5: LAUNCH EC2 INSTANCE IN A PUBLIC SUBNET ###
1) Launch an ec2 instance inside your public subnet

### STEP 6: ACCESS EC2 INSTANCE VIA EC2 INSTANCE CONNECT ###
1) connect your newly created instance using ec2 instance connect
